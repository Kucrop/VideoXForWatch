# VideoXForWatch
A new application with video function for watch.
ï¼ˆMy English is not Well.)

If you have a smart watch and want to watch some videos on the watch.

First,the software won't be updated often.

Why I upload these codes to Github?
-In fact,I don't know why.

The software is on the Ticwear's Appstore(China)now,
In the future,it may be on Wear OS(WearOS by Google).

I used Android Studio to develop it,
if you want to develop it for me(Don't mind it),
you can download it from Github and Open it on Android Studio.

(Perhaps the software can be open by other development tools.)
